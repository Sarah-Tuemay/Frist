        I love it when you call me señorita
        I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
        But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
        It's true, la-la-la
        Ooh, I should be running
        Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

        Land in Miami
        The air was hot from summer rain
        Sweat dripping off me
        Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
        It felt like ooh, la-la-la
        Yeah, no
        Sapphire moonlight
        We danced for hours in the sand
        Tequila Sunrise
        Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
        It felt like ooh, la-la-la, yeah

        I love it when you call me señorita
        I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
        But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
        It's true, la-la-la
        Ooh, I should be running
        Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
        I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
        But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
        It's true, la-la-la
        Ooh, I should be running
        Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

        Locked in the hotel
        There's just some things that never change
        You say we're just friends
        But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
        'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
        Don't you let me fall, oh

        Ooh, when your lips undress me
        Hooked on your tongue
        Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
        Don't stop

        I love it when you call me señorita
        I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
        But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
        It's true, la-la-la
        Ooh, I should be running
        Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
        I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
        But every touch is ooh, la-la-la
        It's true, la-la-la (true, la-la)
        Ooh, I should be running
        Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

        All along I've been coming for ya (for ya)
        And I hope it meant something to ya (ooh)
        Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
        Coming for ya, coming for ya, coming for ya

        For ya
        For ya (oh, she loves it when I call)
        For ya

        Ooh, I should be running
        Ooh, you keep me coming for ya</pre>

            I wanna follow where she goes
            I think about her and she knows it
            I wanna let her take control
            'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

            She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', hm
            And maybe I should stop and start confessin'
            Confessin', yeah

            Oh, I've been shakin', I love it when you go crazy
            You take all my inhibitions
            Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
            You take me places that tear up my reputation

            There's nothing holdin' me back
            There's nothing holdin' me back

            She says that she's never afraid
            Just picture everybody naked
            She really doesn't like to wait
            Not really into hesitation

            I thought that I'd been hurt before
            But no one's ever left me quite this sore
            Your words cut deeper than a knife
            Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
            
            Got a feeling that I'm going under
            But I know that I'll make it out alive
            If I quit calling you my lover
            Move on
            
            You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
            Shaking, falling onto my knees
            And now that I'm without your kisses
            I'll be needing stitches
            Tripping over myself
            Aching, begging you to come help
            And now that I'm without your kisses
            I'll be needing stitches
            
            Just like a moth drawn to a flame
            Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
            Your bitter heart cold to the touch
            Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
            I'm left seeing red on my own
